# Blogging Platform

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, make env file and add the below environment variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URI="YOUR MONGO URI"
DB_NAME="DB_NAME"
NEXTAUTH_URL="ANY URL YOU WANT TO REDIRECT AFTER LOGOUT"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="YOUR SECRET KEY"
```

After your env variables have been initialized you need to run the following command:

```bash
npm install
#Or
npm i
```

And then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
